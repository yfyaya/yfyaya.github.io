Traveling time forecasting, the core component in GPS navigation systems and taxi-hailing apps, has attracted widespread attention. The conventional approaches mainly focus on the routing algorithms on a given stationary road network, ignoring the real-time dynamic change of traffic conditions and the relationship between adjacent road segments, which will significantly affect the planning of the optimal route. Motivated by the above observation, we propose a novel dynamic routing planning framework DTT-STG integrated with map-matching, road speed forecasting, and route planning with full consideration of the dynamic spatial and temporal dependency from a large receptive field. DTT-STG innovatively designs an angle-based map-matching algorithm to describe the direction of vehicles and utilizes a spatial diffusion and temporal attention block to capture the features from the nearby road segments. Afterward, the progressive method is exploited to calculate the traveling time and plan the shortest route dynamically in continuously changing traffic conditions. The comprehensive experiments indicate that DTT-STG achieves higher accuracy and efficiency than other off-the-shelf models.
